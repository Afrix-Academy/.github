The rapid pace of technological advancements intensifies the skills gap between what is taught at the university and what is found in the job market. The existing academic approach at the university level often focuses heavily on theoretical concepts. This leaves students ill-prepared to tackle practical challenges encountered in professional tech roles. As a result, graduates face difficulties in securing employment due to a lack of relevant practical skills and experience.
